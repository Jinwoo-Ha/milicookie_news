rewrite_articles_in_korean:
  description: >
    Take the 7 prioritized defense news articles and rewrite them completely
    in Korean with maximum detail and accuracy. Base your writing strictly on the
    original source material, expanding on technical details, strategic implications,
    and contextual information found in the source articles.
    
    FIRST, generate a "Today's Briefing" section at the very top.
    This section must list the titles of all 7 articles cleanly.
    Format:
    # <오늘의 주요 뉴스>
    01. [Korean Title of Article 1]
    02. [Korean Title of Article 2]
    ...
    07. [Korean Title of Article 7]
    
    ---

    THEN, for each article, structure the content as follows -
    1) Korean headline as the article title
    2) A <배경> section providing essential background context such as geopolitical
    situation, historical background, and relevant strategic frameworks. Do NOT
    include terminology explanations or glossary-style definitions.
    3) A <기사> section containing the full comprehensive Korean article text
    with detailed coverage based on the original source.
    4) End with Original Source showing only the source news outlet name, not the URL.
    For example - Original Source: Defense News  or  Original Source: Breaking Defense
    Ensure proper Korean military terminology throughout and maintain journalistic
    precision. Articles MUST be written in the formal "~다" style (plain form),
    avoiding polite endings like "~습니다" or "~해요". Do not include any separate
    terminology explanation sections.
    
    CRITICAL FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS:
    - You MUST number the articles sequentially from 1 to 7. Do not restart numbering.
    - Title Format: Use Markdown H2 (##) for titles. 
      Example: ## 1. K2 전차, 폴란드 추가 수출 계약 체결
    - Do NOT use "1.", "1)" or standard list numbering for the title line. ONLY use "## Number. Title".
    - Between articles, insert a horizontal rule (---) for separation.
  expected_output: >
    The output MUST start with the summary list, followed by the 7 detailed articles.
    
    Strictly follow this example structure:

    # <오늘의 주요 뉴스>
    01. [Title 1]
    02. [Title 2]
    ...
    07. [Title 7]

    ---

    ## 1. [Korean Title of Article 1]

    <배경>
    [Detailed background context...]

    <기사>
    [Detailed article content...]

    Original Source: [Source Name]

    ---

    ## 2. [Korean Title of Article 2]
    ...

    (Continue until ## 7.)
    
    Each article should be substantially detailed, informative, and accessible
    to Korean readers. 

    Do not include terminology glossaries or definition lists.

    CRITICAL FORMATTING FOR "Original Source":
    - Ensure there is a blank line BEFORE "Original Source".
    - Ensure there is a blank line AFTER "Original Source" before the horizontal rule (---).
    - Example:
      ...last sentence of article.

      Original Source: Defense News
