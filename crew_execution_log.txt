## 1. 미 공군, 이란 핵 공격 이후 벙커버스터 폭탄 추가 도입 결정

<배경>  
2026년 2월 최근 이란발 핵 공격이 중동 지역 긴장을 극도로 고조시키고 있다. 이란과 미국 간의 오랜 적대적 관계는 1979년 이란 혁명 이후 지속되어 왔으며, 2015년 이란 핵합의(JCPOA) 이후에도 불신과 군사적 대치가 이어졌다. 최근 이란의 핵 공격으로 인해 미국은 중동 내 군사력 증강과 전략적 억지력 강화를 추진하고 있다. 벙커버스터 폭탄은 지하 깊숙이 구축된 군사시설, 핵시설 등 고도로 방호된 목표물을 타격하기 위해 개발된 대형 유도폭탄으로, 미국의 대이란 전략에서 핵심적 수단으로 활용되고 있다.

<기사>  
미국 공군이 최근 이란발 핵 공격 이후 3만 파운드급 벙커버스터 폭탄(GUIDED BUNKER-BUSTER BOMB) 추가 도입을 결정했다고 밝혔다. 이는 이란의 지하 핵시설 및 군사 인프라를 겨냥한 대응 조치로, 미국의 군사적 입장이 한층 강화되고 있음을 시사한다.

미 공군이 도입하는 벙커버스터는 일반 항공폭탄과 달리 두꺼운 콘크리트와 암반을 관통해 깊은 지하 목표물을 정밀 타격할 수 있도록 설계된 무기다. 대표적으로 GBU-57A/B Massive Ordnance Penetrator(MOP)가 있으며, 이 무기는 30,000파운드(약 13.6톤)에 달하는 위력을 갖추고 있다. 해당 폭탄은 B-2 스텔스 폭격기 등 전략폭격기에 탑재되어 운용되며, 이란의 깊숙한 지하 핵시설 파괴를 목적으로 개발됐다.

미국 국방부 고위 관계자는 "이란이 핵 공격을 감행한 이후, 중동 내 미국 및 동맹국 안보를 보장하기 위해서는 보다 강력한 억지력과 능동적 타격능력이 필수적"이라고 강조했다. 실제로 이란은 수십 미터 깊이의 암반 아래 핵시설을 건설해왔으며, 기존 폭탄으로는 파괴가 어려웠던 만큼 벙커버스터 추가 도입은 군사적 실효성을 크게 높일 전망이다.

이번 조치는 이란에 대한 직접적 경고이자, 향후 군사적 충돌 가능성에 대비한 선제적 무장 강화로 해석된다. 또한, 중동 지역 내 미국 군사력의 확장과 더불어 이스라엘 등 지역 동맹국에 대한 안보공약 재확인 차원에서도 중요한 의미를 가진다. 벙커버스터 폭탄 확대 도입은 단순한 무기 증강을 넘어, 미국이 이란 핵 위협에 대해 결코 좌시하지 않겠다는 명확한 메시지를 담고 있다.

## 2. 미 국방부, 나이지리아에 약 200명 추가 파병

<배경>  
아프리카 나이지리아는 세계에서 가장 인구가 많은 국가 중 하나이자 서아프리카의 지정학적 요충지다. 그러나 보코하람(Boko Haram)과 이슬람국가 서아프리카 지부(ISWAP) 등 이슬람 극단주의 무장세력의 지속적 테러와 반군 활동으로 인해 불안정이 지속되고 있다. 미국은 아프리카 내 테러 위협과 지역 안보 불안정에 대응하기 위해 나이지리아 정부와 지속적으로 군사협력을 강화해 왔다. 최근 들어 나이지리아 내 무장세력의 활동이 더욱 격화되면서 미국의 군사적 개입이 한층 확대되고 있다.

<기사>  
미국 국방부가 약 200명의 병력을 나이지리아에 추가 파병하기로 결정했다고 13일(현지시간) 발표했다. 이번 조치는 나이지리아 내에서 지속적으로 증가하는 반군 및 테러리스트 위협에 대응하고, 현지 안보 역량 강화를 위한 지원 차원에서 이루어졌다.

현재 나이지리아는 보코하람과 ISWAP 등 무장세력의 공격으로 인해 정부 시설, 군사기지, 민간인 거주지 등이 반복적으로 피해를 입고 있다. 미국은 그간 정보·감시·정찰(ISR) 자산 지원, 군사 훈련, 장비 제공 등 다양한 방식으로 나이지리아군을 지원해 왔으나, 최근 반군 활동이 더욱 격화되면서 직접적인 미군 병력 증원이 불가피하다는 판단에 이르렀다.

이번에 파견되는 미군은 주로 특수작전, 정보 분석, 테러 대응 훈련 등 임무를 수행할 예정이다. 미 국방부 관계자는 "나이지리아 정부 및 군과 긴밀히 협력하여 지역 내 테러 위협 억제와 안보 안정화에 기여할 것"이라고 밝혔다. 또한, 미군 파병은 나이지리아뿐 아니라 서아프리카 전체의 안보 환경 개선과, 아프리카 내 미군 존재감을 강화하는 효과도 기대된다.

다만, 미군의 추가 파병이 지역 내 미-중 경쟁 구도, 현지 반미 감정, 그리고 미국의 군사적 개입에 대한 국제사회 우려 등 복합적인 외교적 과제를 동반할 수 있음도 지적되고 있다. 미국은 앞으로도 나이지리아와의 군사 협력을 지속적으로 확대해 나갈 방침이다.

## 3. 미 항공모함 제럴드 포드호, 중동 지역 두 번째 배치

<배경>  
중동 지역은 오랜 기간 국제사회의 군사적 긴장과 분쟁의 중심지로, 미국은 역내 전략적 이익 보호와 동맹 안보 보장을 위해 항공모함 전단을 상시 배치해 왔다. 최근 이란의 핵 공격과 관련한 군사적 긴장이 급격히 고조됨에 따라, 미국의 해상 전력 증강 필요성이 부각되고 있다. 특히 항공모함은 미 해군의 대규모 군사력 투사와 전구(戰區) 내 신속 대응의 핵심 자산이다.

<기사>  
미 해군이 최신예 항공모함인 제럴드 R. 포드(USS Gerald R. Ford, CVN-78)호를 중동 지역에 배치했다고 현지 언론이 13일 보도했다. 이는 최근 중동 내 긴장 고조에 따라 두 번째 항공모함이 해당 지역에 전개된 것으로, 미국의 군사적 대응 태세가 한층 강화되고 있음을 의미한다.

제럴드 포드호는 미 해군이 운용하는 가장 최신형 항공모함으로, 첨단 전자식 사출 시스템(EMALS) 및 고성능 레이더, 자동화된 무기 시스템 등 최첨단 기술이 대거 적용됐다. 2023년 초도 작전 배치를 시작한 포드급 항모는 기존 니미츠급 대비 항공기 운용 효율성과 생존성이 크게 향상되었다.

이번 배치 결정은 이란의 군사적 도발과 핵 공격 이후 미국과 동맹국 안보에 대한 우려가 고조되는 가운데, 역내 군사력 투사와 억지력 강화 차원에서 이루어졌다. 미 해군 관계자는 "중동 지역의 안정과 미국 및 동맹국 이익 수호를 위해 필요시 신속한 대응이 가능하도록 항공모함 전단을 증강 배치했다"고 밝혔다.

항공모함 2척의 동시 배치는 잠재적 적국에 대한 강력한 경고 신호로 해석된다. 특히 이란이 미군 및 동맹국에 대한 추가 도발을 시도할 경우, 미 해군은 즉각적인 항공타격 및 해상작전 수행이 가능하다. 또한 이번 조치는 이스라엘, 사우디아라비아 등 역내 동맹국에 대한 미국의 안보 공약을 재확인하는 의미도 갖는다.

## 4. 미 국방부, 미 인프라 보호 위한 대드론 센서 긴급 도입 추진

<배경>  
최근 상업용 및 군용 무인기(드론)의 확산으로 인해, 미국 내 중요 기반시설(전력망, 통신시설, 군사지휘소 등)에 대한 드론 위협이 급증하고 있다. 드론을 활용한 테러, 첩보, 사이버 공격 가능성이 현실화되면서, 미 국방부는 인프라 보호를 위한 새로운 방어체계 구축의 필요성을 제기해왔다. 대드론 센서는 이러한 위협에 대응하기 위한 핵심 방어자산으로, 최신 기술 및 조기경보 체계 도입이 시급한 과제로 부상했다.

<기사>  
미 국방부가 미국 내 각종 중요 인프라 시설을 보호하기 위해 첨단 대드론 센서 체계의 신속한 도입을 추진하고 있다. 이는 최근 드론을 이용한 위협이 급증함에 따라, 기존 방공체계로는 감지·방어가 어려운 소형·저고도 드론 공격에 효과적으로 대응하기 위한 조치다.

국방부는 "드론 위협은 상업용 저가 드론부터 군사용 정찰·공격 드론까지 다양하게 진화하고 있으며, 이에 따라 인프라 방어 패러다임의 전환이 불가피하다"고 밝혔다. 현재 추진 중인 대드론 센서 사업은 레이더, 광학·적외선 감지기, 전자전(EW) 장비 등 다양한 탐지·차단 기술을 통합한 형태로 설계되고 있다.

특히 미 국방부는 민간 전력망, 수도시설, 항만·공항 등 전략적 중요시설을 대상으로 우선 배치할 계획이다. 해당 센서는 드론의 침입 경로를 실시간으로 추적·분석할 수 있으며, 자동화된 차단 시스템과 연동해 위협 발생 시 신속 대응이 가능하다. 이와 함께 AI 기반 위협 평가, 사이버전 대응 기능 등 첨단 기술이 적용될 예정이다.

국방부는 "미국 내 인프라를 향한 드론 공격이 실제로 발생할 경우, 국가안보와 국민 안전에 심각한 영향을 미칠 수 있다"며, 관련 예산 및 연구개발 투자를 대폭 확대하고 있다. 대드론 센서 도입이 본격화되면, 미국 방산업계의 기술 혁신과 대테러 역량 강화에도 크게 기여할 전망이다.

## 5. 루비오 상원의원, 유럽에 미-유럽관계 단절 우려 불식 촉구

<배경>  
최근 미국의 대외정책 변화 및 2024년 미 대선 이후 유럽 내에서는 미-유럽관계, 특히 나토(NATO) 동맹에 대한 불확실성이 대두되고 있다. 러시아-우크라이나 전쟁, 중국의 부상 등 국제정세 변화 속에서 미국과 유럽 간 안보 연대는 그 어느 때보다 중요한 상황이다. 일부에서는 미국의 고립주의 강화와 유럽 안보 지원 약화 가능성에 대한 우려가 확산되고 있다.

<기사>  
마르코 루비오 미국 상원의원이 최근 유럽 주요 동맹국들을 상대로 "미국이 결코 대서양 동맹을 단절하거나, 유럽 안보를 외면하지 않을 것"이라고 강조했다. 이는 최근 미국 내 대외정책 논란과 일부 고립주의 성향에 대한 유럽 내 우려를 불식시키기 위한 일련의 공개 메시지로 해석된다.

루비오 의원은 "미국과 유럽은 러시아, 중국 등 공동의 안보 위협에 맞서 긴밀히 협력해야 한다"며, "NATO를 비롯한 집단방위체계의 결속이 그 어느 때보다 중요하다"고 역설했다. 특히 우크라이나 사태 장기화, 유럽 내 방위비 분담 논의 등 복합적 도전 속에서, 미국의 유럽 안보공약이 흔들리지 않을 것임을 재차 확인했다.

이번 발언은 최근 일부 미 정치권 인사들이 방위공약 재검토, 해외 주둔 미군 감축 등을 주장하면서 유럽 내 불안감이 높아진 상황에서 나왔다. 루비오 의원은 "유럽 동맹국들의 신뢰를 회복하고, 공동의 전략 목표 달성을 위해 미국은 지속적으로 유럽과 연대할 것"이라고 밝혔다.

이와 함께, 루비오 의원은 미국 내 정치 상황 변화에도 불구하고, 양측 간 정보공유, 방산 협력, 군사훈련 등이 안정적으로 유지될 것임을 강조했다. 유럽 동맹국들은 이번 메시지에 대해 대체로 환영하는 분위기이며, 미-유럽 간 전략적 파트너십의 중요성이 재확인된 것으로 평가된다.

## 6. FCAS 사업은 존속 전망… 차세대 전투기 협상은 사실상 결렬

<배경>  
유럽의 미래전투체계(Future Combat Air System, FCAS) 사업은 프랑스, 독일, 스페인 등이 주도하는 차세대 군집항공전력 개발 프로젝트다. FCAS는 유인·무인 전투기, 인공지능, 클라우드 기반 지휘통제 등 첨단 기술을 융합해 2040년대 유럽 공군력의 핵심이 될 것으로 기대됐다. 그러나 최근 각국의 방산기업 간 이견, 예산·기술 분담 문제, 전략적 이해관계 충돌로 인해 차세대 전투기(Next-Gen Fighter) 협상 진전에 난항을 겪어왔다.

<기사>  
업계 소식통에 따르면, FCAS(미래전투체계) 사업 자체는 가까스로 존속할 전망이나, 핵심인 차세대 전투기 개발 협상은 사실상 결렬된 것으로 전해졌다. 이로 인해 유럽 방위산업의 통합적 군집항공전력 확보 계획에 차질이 불가피할 것으로 보인다.

프랑스, 독일, 스페인 정부 및 주요 방산기업들은 FCAS를 통해 유럽 독자적 항공우위 확보와 미국, 중국 등 외부 경쟁국에 대한 전략적 대응을 꾀해왔다. FCAS는 유인 차세대 전투기(NGF)와 무인 윙맨(드론), 인공지능 기반 네트워크 등을 통합하는 대형 플랫폼이다. 그러나 최근 각국의 기술 이전, 지분 배분, 예산 부담 등 핵심 사안에서 이견이 심화되면서, 차세대 전투기 공동개발 논의가 사실상 중단된 것으로 알려졌다.

업계 관계자는 "FCAS 사업 자체는 정보통신, 무인기, 지휘통제 시스템 등 일부 분야에서 계속 진행될 수 있으나, 차세대 전투기라는 핵심 분야에선 협상 의지가 거의 사라졌다"고 전했다. 이에 따라 향후 각국이 독자적 전투기 개발로 방향을 선회할 가능성도 거론된다.

이 같은 상황은 유럽 내 방위산업 협력의 한계와, NATO의 집단 항공력 강화에 악영향을 줄 수 있다는 우려를 낳고 있다. 특히 러시아, 중국 등 외부 위협이 고조되는 가운데, 유럽의 차세대 공군력 확보가 지연될 경우 전략적 공백이 발생할 수 있다. 유럽 각국 및 방산업계는 FCAS 사업의 일부 존속과 별개로, 새로운 협력 방식 도출이 시급하다는 지적이 제기된다.

## 7. 미 해군, 무인잠수정(UUV) 작전 지원 위한 해저 네트워크 개발 착수

<배경>  
무인잠수정(UUV)은 현대 해군작전에서 정찰, 기뢰탐지, 대잠수함전 등 다양한 임무를 수행하는 핵심 플랫폼으로 부상하고 있다. 특히 미 해군은 태평양, 대서양 등 광활한 해역에서 네트워크 중심의 무인수중작전 능력 강화를 중점 추진 중이다. 기존 통신 한계로 인해 UUV의 실시간 명령·제어, 데이터 공유에 어려움이 있었으며, 신속하고 안정적인 해저 네트워크 구축이 첨단 해군력 확보의 관건으로 부각되고 있다.

<기사>  
미 해군이 무인잠수정(UUV) 운용 능력 극대화를 위해 첨단 해저 네트워크(Undersea Networking Capability) 개발에 본격 착수했다. 이는 UUV의 실시간 명령·제어, 데이터 공유, 협동작전 수행 등 핵심 임무수행 능력을 획기적으로 향상시키기 위한 조치다.

새롭게 개발되는 해저 네트워크는 음파통신, 해저 광케이블, 위성연계 등 다양한 수단을 결합하여, UUV와 유인 잠수함, 수상함 간 실시간 통신이 가능하도록 설계된다. 이를 통해, 해저 환경에서 일어나는 각종 정보수집·정찰 임무, 기뢰탐지, 적 잠수함 추적 등에서 UUV의 독립적·협동적 운용이 한층 용이해진다.

미 해군 관계자는 "기존에는 UUV가 단독 임무 수행이나 사전 프로그램에 의존했으나, 네트워크 기반 작전이 현실화되면 다수의 UUV가 동시·연동 작전을 수행할 수 있다"고 설명했다. 또한, 해저 네트워크는 AI 기반 데이터 분석, 보안 강화 통신 등 첨단 기술이 적용되어, 해상 및 해저 전장 인식능력도 크게 높일 전망이다.

이번 개발 사업은 미 해군의 미래 해양작전 패러다임 변화의 일환으로, 장기적으로는 동맹국과의 해양 정보 공유, 연합 작전 능력 강화에도 기여할 것으로 기대된다. 해저 네트워크 완성 시, 미국 해군은 전 세계 해양에서 보다 신속하고 정밀한 대응 능력을 확보할 수 있게 된다.
